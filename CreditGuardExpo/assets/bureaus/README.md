# Bureau Logos

This directory should contain the official bureau logo images:

- `equifax-logo.png` - Equifax logo (brand color: #E31937)
- `transunion-logo.png` - TransUnion logo (brand color: #0066B2)
- `experian-logo.png` - Experian logo (brand color: #003DA5)

## Logo Specifications

- Format: PNG with transparent background
- Size: 48x48px or 96x96px (for @2x/@3x support)
- Style: Official bureau logos or simplified icon versions
- Ensure logos are properly licensed for use in your application

## Current Implementation

The `BureauDropdown` component is configured to display these logos when available. If a logo is not found, it will fall back to displaying an Ionicons icon instead.

## Where to Get Logos

- Download from official bureau websites (check licensing)
- Use brand asset kits from bureau developer portals
- Create simplified versions if official logos cannot be used
- Consider using icon libraries with bureau-like shield icons as placeholders
